~~1. Create receive and send progress ui:~~

~~- Send: show list of files sending and their progress~~
~~- Receive: show list of files received with download btn, have current file show progress~~
^ will still be improved
~~2. Add UI for when offer is rejected on sender side~~
3. When transfer is done, add button to return to "awaiting offer" on receive side, reset everything (maybe?)
4. Error handling, unexpected disconnect during send
